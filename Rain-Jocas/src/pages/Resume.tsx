        <p>FLIP National’s website (React)- I helped code FLIP National’s professional website, completely

          map, an audio player for their podcast, and a search function.</p>
        <p>Sudoku Puzzle (Java) - I created a program which reads a file with an incomplete Sudoku puzzle,
          solves it, and then outputs the completed puzzle.</p>
        <p>Lexicon (Java) - I programmed a Lexicon which reads a file, adds words to the lexicon, suggests
          corrections, finds similar words, and has searching capabilities.</p>
        <p>Shell program (C) - I created a program similar to the BASH terminal, by using system calls,
          signal handlers, and signal masks.</p>
